  - Light theme: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)` 
  - Dark theme: `rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.95)`
- Added `-webkit-backdrop-filter` for better iOS support
- Increased z-index to 1001 to prevent overlay issues
- Applied same fixes to mobile dropdown menu styles

### 2. **Skills Section Carousel Implementation**

- **CSS Changes**:
  - `.mobile-only` hidden by default, shown in mobile media queries
